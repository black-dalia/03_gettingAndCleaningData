# 03_gettingAndCleaningData
peer graded assignment for week 4 of module 03 Getting and Cleaning the Data

This project contains:
- the script to run: peer-graded.R fully commented (read warning before running). No need to have the files from Samsung downloaded already, this script will download them in the temporary working directory.
- the tidy table output from the script (this table will also be created by the script in the temporary directory, see comments in scripts): peer_graded_tidyTable.txt
- the codebook (pdf file): codebook.pdf
- the markdown script for the codebook: codebook.Rmd 
- the R script that helps output the description table: codebook_variableTable.R
- an html showing distribution and missing values (if any) of the variables: distribution.html
- figures of distributions for each values: directory figure

How to run this project? 
- download peer-graded.R in a directory and run (Source)
- a directory will be created containing all downloaded files and table output. You should remove it manually afterwards. 
- read the codebook\
The other files are here to show how I created the codebook. 

I wish you a smooth run, and thank you for grading me!
